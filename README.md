# Event-Driven JavaScript Sorting Algorithms

This project implements common comparison-based sorting algorithms in an event-driven manner that allows for step-by-step display of array state. It also includes an undo buffer so that sorting steps can be reversed. 

See http://rylan.coffee/s/ for the implementation.

Comments and suggestions are welcome!

### Sorting Algorithms

Currently, the following comparison-based sorting algorithms have been implemented: 

1. Selection Sort

2. Insertion Sort

3. Quick Sort

The following are yet to be included: 

1. Heap Sort

2. Merge Sort

### Display

In order to implement this in a standards-compliant way, I will be using jQuery, underscore.js (or lodash.js) and backbone.js to build a Model-View-Collection single-page app. 

I intend to use d3.js to build SVG elements that represent the array being sorted.
