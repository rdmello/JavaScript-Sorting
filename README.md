# JavaScript Sorting Algorithms

This is a practice project for implementing and displaying JS sorting algorithms. 

See http://rylan.coffee/s/ for the implementation 

Comments and suggestions are welcome!

### Sorting Algorithms

Currently, I have implemented some comparison-based sorting algorithms: 

1. Selection Sort

2. Insertion Sort

3. Heap Sort

4. Merge Sort

5. Quick Sort

Bucket sort and Radix sort will be implemented soon. I will also add support for sorting linked-lists. 

### Display

In order to implement this in a standards-compliant way, I will be using jQuery, underscore.js (or lodash.js) and backbone.js to build a Model-View-Collection single-page app. 

I intend to use d3.js to build SVG elements that represent the array being sorted.
