# Event-Driven JavaScript Sorting Algorithms

This project implements common comparison-based sorting algorithms in an event-driven manner that allows for step-by-step display of array state. It also includes an undo buffer so that sorting steps can be reversed. 

See http://rylan.coffee/s/ for the implementation.

Comments and suggestions are welcome!

### Sorting Algorithms

Currently, the following comparison-based sorting algorithms have been implemented: 

1. Selection Sort

2. Insertion Sort

3. Bubble Sort

4. Quick Sort

5. Merge Sort

6. Heap Sort

### Additional Libraries

This project uses: 

1. Font Awesome to display play/pause, reload, and forward/backward buttons

2. Underscore.js for some syntactic sugar

3. Vue.js to generate the HTML for the six sorting algorithm visualizations and to work with events

4. d3.js to move the rectangles around within each sorting visualization. This is not strictly necessary, and I will look into display purely using Vue.js

5. Pure.css for a lightweight responsive library

6. Raleway font for a professional look
